This project provides a demonstration of the experimental Android schema in the OVAL Sandbox.
It is solely provided as a proof of concept demonstration and is in no way a polished product.
Feedback would be appreciated and can be sent publicly to the oval-developer-list mailing list or privately to
mpeck@mitre.org and oval@mitre.org. 

When the application runs, it takes as input an OVAL definitions file in the device's external storage directory.
By default, the input file is called "android-test.xml", but the user can change the name in the GUI.
An example android-test.xml is provided in this project that ensures all the system information will be gathered and
also includes these four sample checks:
oval:android.test:def:2101 Evaluates to true if USB debugging is turned off
oval:android.test:def:2102 Evaluates to true if allow non-market apps is turned off
oval:android.test:def:2103 Evaluates to true if minimum password length policy is at least 6
oval:android.test:def:2104 Evaluates to false if any non-system apps (i.e. removable by the user rather than included in the OS) that request GET_TASKS permission are installed

The application outputs an Android system characteristics file to the device's external storage directory.
By default, the output file is called "android-system-char.xml", but the user can change the name in the GUI.

The inputted OVAL definitions file and outputted Android system characteristics file can be provided to the ovaldi
OVAL interpreter.  For example:
ovaldi -m -i android-system-char.xml -o test.xml

Some gap areas:
Each item is always marked as COMPLETE in the output system characteristics no matter what.
Filtering is not yet implemented - all app_manager_items, etc. are gathered.
The app should work on Android 2.2 and up but most of our testing was done with Android 4.0 and 4.2.

androidsc2.jar was generated by running:
(Using scomp from XMLBeans 2.6.0)
scomp -out androidsc.jar x-android-system-characteristics.xsd
java -jar jarjar-1.4.jar process jarjar.r androidsc.jar androidsc2.jar
(Where jarjar.r contains: rule javax.xml.stream.** org.test.javax.xml.stream.@1)

xbean22.jar and jsr173-2.jar were generated by running:
(The source files were provided in XMLBeans 2.6.0)
java -jar jarjar-1.4.jar process jarjar.r xbean2.jar xbean22.jar
java -jar jarjar-1.4.jar process jarjar.r jsr173_1.0_api.jar jsr173-2.jar
