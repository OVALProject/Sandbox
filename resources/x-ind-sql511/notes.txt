sql57 Test Support
==================

Experimental code implementing this test may be found in the ovaldi Subversion
source repository branch:

https://ovaldi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/ovaldi/branches/sql57_probes

Windows:
--------

On Windows, the probe is implemented using the .NET data API.  This API works 
via "providers", and the sample definition was written using ODBC to query a
MySQL database.  This means you must have a suitable ODBC datasource set up.
Setting up an ODBC datasource which can query a MySQL database requires a
MySQL ODBC driver be installed.  Note that the bitness of the driver must
match the bitness of the ODBC datasource and of the ovaldi build.  MySQL ODBC
drivers are available at:

http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/odbc/

The Windows sql57 probe implementation selects a data provider based on the
<engine> object entity, and rather than add MySQL as a legal enumerator for
that entity, a generic "odbc" enumerator was added which specifically instructs
the probe to use the ODBC provider.  This enables interoperability with any
ODBC-capable database.  In keeping with the pattern established by the other
enumerators though, the "odbc" enumerator will probably be replaced with actual
database names in the future.

On a 64-bit Windows computer, you can configure 32-bit ODBC datasources by
running:

C:\Windows\SysWOW64\odbcad32.exe

You can configure 64-bit ODBC datasources by navigating to the control panel:

Control Panel -> Adminstrative Tools -> Data Sources (ODBC)

or by running

C:\Windows\System32\odbcad32.exe

Linux:
------

The Linux implementation of the probe uses the libodbc++ library, which provides
an easier to use C++ wrapper around the raw ODBC API.  libodbc++ is available
from:

http://libodbcxx.sourceforge.net/

libodbc++ requires an ODBC driver manager implementation to wrap.  It is
compatible with two: unixODBC and iODBC.  Their homepages are:

http://www.unixodbc.org/
http://www.iodbc.org/

It doesn't matter which you use; ovaldi has no direct dependency on either.
Within the driver manager, you must install an ODBC driver.  The details of this
vary slightly between the managers, and depend on how they were configured when
they were built.  Once your ODBC driver manager and driver are set up and 
working, ovaldi should be able to run queries against your database.

The probe was tested on linux (rhel5) using unixODBC.  For information on
setting up drivers and datasources for unixODBC using commandline tools, see:

http://www.unixodbc.org/odbcinst.html

MySQL drivers for Linux are available from the same source as Windows (see
above).
