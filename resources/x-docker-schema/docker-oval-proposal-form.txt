OVAL Proposal Form
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The OVAL Proposal Form is used by members of the community to prepare proposals 
for migration into an official release of OVAL. The form will be critical in 
helping the members of the community understand, review, and vet proposals.

Once an OVAL Proposal Form is submitted to the oval-developer-list, the OVAL 
Moderator will review and verify the proposal for completeness at which point 
it will be ready for community review and discussion. 

When a new proposal is introduced to the community, the OVAL Moderator will 
work with the OVAL Board to determine the impact of the proposal. If the 
proposal is deemed a high impact change, it must be developed in the OVAL 
Sandbox which will require the completion of this form as well as an OVAL 
Board vote before it is migrated into an official release. More information 
about the OVAL Board Voting Process can be found at [1]. If the proposal is 
deemed a low impact change, the proposed change can be made directly to an 
official OVAL release.

Please direct any questions or concerns to MITRE at oval@mitre.org.

Steps to Take
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Review the OVAL Language Sandbox page [2] and the Requesting Changes to the 
OVAL Language page [3].

2) Complete the form provided below.

3) Email the completed form to the oval-developer-list at 
oval-developer-list@lists.mitre.org with a subject of 
"FOR REVIEW: <Proposal Name> Proposal Form".

4) Revise the proposal, as needed, based on community discussion and feedback.

Introduction to Proposal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) What is the new capability?

The OVAL schemas for Docker provide a standards-based capability to check configurations
related to a Docker installation and/or containers and images installed in a Docker 
infrastructure.

2) Why is the new capability needed?

The Docker OVAL schemas are needed to provide a standards-based capability 
to check Docker installation configuration as well as configuration of installed 
containers or images.  

3) What is the version of the targeted official OVAL release?

The targeted OVAL version for this proposal is OVAL 5.12.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benefits of Proposal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) How does the proposal relate to existing OVAL use cases [4]?
The tests provide capabilities to express and assess Docker configuration for the 
following OVAL use cases: 

* Configuration Management

2) What does this proposal enable that cannot currently be accomplished in the 
OVAL Language?

The OVAL Language does not currently include any Docker-specific schemas.  

The proposed Docker schema provides the ability to check:
* Installed version information
* Currently executing process information for those processes executing within 
  a Docker container/image (similar to the Unix schema's process58_test)
* Information regarding a Docker installation, such as numbers of running containers, 
  total number of containers, backing filesystems and backing architectures
* Inspection information for any installed container or image
* Container process information, such as time when a container was created, container 
  up-time, status and size

3) What alternative approaches for supporting these use cases were considered 
and why is this one the best?

We do not believe there are other alternative methods for interrogating or assessing 
Docker.  Most output from Docker commands is rendered as JSON, for which no OVAL 
constructs currently exist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Impacts of Proposal
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Which existing OVAL schemas are affected by this proposal?  

None.

2) Does the proposal break backward compatibility with previous versions?  
Please see OVAL Versioning Policy [5] for more information.

This proposal does not break backward compatibility.  

2) How will the proposed changes impact OVAL content authors?

This will provide OVAL content authors with the ability to create new 
content based on the new tests.  We have created proof-of-concept OVAL 
definitions demonstrating the ability to automate useful compliance checks.  

3) How will the proposed changes impact OVAL content consumers?

No impact to current OVAL content consumers.  These changes will provide 
an opportunity to use OVAL to create configuration management/assessment 
content for Docker.

4) How will the proposed changes impact existing OVAL content?

No impact.

5) How will the proposed changes impact existing OVAL implementations?

The impact will depend on whether the existing OVAL implementations need to 
implement Docker-specific schema features.  In many cases it will not be 
necessary.

6) Are there any concerns regarding this proposal (e.g., undocumented APIs, 
etc.)? If so, are there any mitigating factors?  

As Docker is a rapidly evolving technology, the only concerns are that when 
updated versions of Docker are released, commands, command options, and/or 
APIs may change.  These changes could have an impact on implementations of 
the Docker schema.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Review
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Do the schema changes follow the accepted naming and design conventions?

Yes.

2) Do the schema changes satisfy the requirements specified in the Requesting 
Changes to the OVAL Language page [3]?

Yes.

3) Do the schema changes align with the targeted official release (e.g., changes 
that break backward compatibility should not target a minor release)? Please 
see the OVAL Versioning Policy [5] for more information.

Yes.

4) Have the new capabilities been successfully implemented and tested with sample 
content?

Yes.
