OVAL Proposal Form
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The OVAL Proposal Form is used by members of the community to prepare proposals for 
migration into an official release of OVAL. The form will be critical in helping the 
members of the community understand, review, and vet proposals.

Once an OVAL Proposal Form is submitted to the oval-developer-list, the OVAL 
Moderator will review and verify the proposal for completeness at which point it will 
be ready for community review and discussion. 

When a new proposal is introduced to the community, the OVAL Moderator will work with 
the OVAL Board to determine the impact of the proposal. If the proposal is deemed a 
high impact change, it must be developed in the OVAL Sandbox which will require the 
completion of this form as well as an OVAL Board vote before it is migrated into an 
official release. More information about the OVAL Board Voting Process can be found 
at [1]. If the proposal is deemed a low impact change, the proposed change can be 
made directly to an official OVAL release.

Please direct any questions or concerns to MITRE at oval@mitre.org.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps to Take
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Review the OVAL Language Sandbox page [2] and the Requesting Changes to the OVAL 
   Language page [3].

2) Complete the form provided below.

3) Email the completed form to the oval-developer-list at 
   oval-developer-list@lists.mitre.org with a subject of 
   "FOR REVIEW: <Proposal Name> Proposal Form".

4) Revise the proposal, as needed, based on community discussion and feedback.

Introduction to Proposal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) What is the new capability?

systemdunitproperty test, systemdunitdependency test and related OVAL structures.

2) Why is the new capability needed?

A number of Linux based distributions have switched their init system from SysVinit
to systemd. The systemd init system is different from the old SysVinit style in that
it does not have a concept of a runlevel, but instead has targets and various forms
of service activation. For example, it can start a service based on achieving
a target (e.g. graphical), time of day, connection to a socket, or a number of
other ways. Please see http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/ for more
information.

3) What is the version of the targeted official OVAL release?

5.11

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Benefits of Proposal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) How does the proposal relate to existing OVAL use cases [4]?

This new functionality provides replacement for the runlevel test on systems that
use systemd instead of sysvinit or compatible init system.

2) What does this proposal enable that cannot currently be accomplished in the OVAL 
   Language?

Reasonably convenient way to query systemd unit properties and dependencies.

3) What alternative approaches for supporting these use cases were considered and 
   why is this one the best?

This functionality can be "emulated" in a number of ways in OVAL. None of these are
robust or convenient to write.

For example the content writer could check the unit files for regex patterns using
the textfilecontent test. This way unit properties can be queried. Or the content
writer could check symlinks in /etc/systemd/$unit_path/$unit.wants to figure out
one level of dependencies.

Both of these approaches have shortcomings. In the first case the unit file may not be
the final file that is used. There are multiple unit files on the system and there are
rules regarding how they are used.

$ locate default.target
/etc/systemd/system/default.target
/etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants
/etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/systemd-readahead-collect.service
/etc/systemd/system/default.target.wants/systemd-readahead-replay.service
/usr/lib/systemd/system/default.target
/usr/lib/systemd/system/default.target.wants
/usr/lib/systemd/user/default.target

In the second case the user wants all transitive dependencies but can only query
the immediate one level dependencies.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Impacts of Proposal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Which existing OVAL schemas are affected by this proposal?

linux-definitions-schema.xsd
linux-system-characteristics-schema.xsd

2) Does the proposal break backward compatibility with previous versions?  Please 
   see OVAL Versioning Policy [5] for more information.

No.

2) How will the proposed changes impact OVAL content authors?

It will provide a new feature for content authors to leverage when checking platforms
that use the systemd init system.

No impact for content targeted at sysvinit platforms.

3) How will the proposed changes impact OVAL content consumers?

If the content consumer supports Linux, support for systemd tests should be added
if the tool supports OVAL 5.11 or later.

4) How will the proposed changes impact existing OVAL content?

No impact.

Content emulating these systemd tests using other OVAL features may be migrated
to the new functionality.

5) How will the proposed changes impact existing OVAL implementations?

Existing OVAL implementations that want to upgrade to support 5.11 will have to
implement the 2 tests proposed.

6) Are there any concerns regarding this proposal (e.g., undocumented APIs, etc.)? 
   If so, are there any mitigating factors?

systemd has no stable C API to leverage. The best choice right now is to look at what
systemctl does and write similar code. This code uses dbus to communicate with
the systemd daemon.

For offline scans where dbus and systemd are not available, the best choice seems
to be "augeas" - http://augeas.net

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Review
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Do the schema changes follow the accepted naming and design conventions?

Yes.

2) Do the schema changes satisfy the requirements specified in the Requesting Changes 
   to the OVAL Language page [3]?

Yes.

3) Do the schema changes align with the targeted official release (e.g., changes that 
   break backward compatibility should not target a minor release)? Please see the 
   OVAL Versioning Policy [5] for more information.

Yes.

4) Have the new capabilities been successfully implemented and tested with sample 
   content?

Yes, these new capabilities have been successfully implemented and tested with sample
content in OpenSCAP.
